**Target:** Sharpe 1.8+, adaptive position sizing

## Overview

DQN/PPO for portfolio management with continuous action spaces

## Why This Matters

Reinforcement learning adapts to changing markets, learns optimal execution

## Key Features

- ✅ DQN with experience replay
- ✅ PPO for continuous actions
- ✅ Reward shaping
- ✅ Risk-adjusted objectives

## Usage

```python
from module03_deep_q_learning import *

# [Module-specific usage example here]
# See full code for detailed implementation
```

## Run Demo

```bash
python module03_deep_q_learning.py
```

## Interview Insight

**Q (Jane Street):** Why RL for trading vs supervised learning?

**A:** RL learns sequences (today's action affects tomorrow's state), handles non-stationarity, optimizes long-term rewards (Sharpe) not just next-step prediction.
