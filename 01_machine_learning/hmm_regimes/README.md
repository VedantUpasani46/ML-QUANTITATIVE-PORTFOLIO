# Module 6: Hidden Markov Models

**Target:** 80%+ regime classification accuracy

## Overview

HMM for market regime detection (Bull/Bear/Crisis)

## Why This Matters

Adapt strategies to market conditions, reduce drawdowns in crashes

## Key Features

- ✅ HMM with 3-4 regimes
- ✅ Viterbi algorithm
- ✅ Regime probabilities
- ✅ Adaptive strategies

## Usage

```python
from module06_hmm_regimes import *

# [Module-specific usage example here]
# See full code for detailed implementation
```

## Run Demo

```bash
python module06_hmm_regimes.py
```

## Technical Details

- **Module:** 6
- **Category:** 01 Machine Learning
- **File:** `module06_hmm_regimes.py`
- **Target:** 80%+ regime classification accuracy

## Interview Insight

**Q (Bridgewater):** How many regimes do you use?

**A:** 3-4 regimes: Bull (high return, low vol), Volatile (high return, high vol), Crisis (negative return, high vol), Sideways. More regimes = overfitting.
